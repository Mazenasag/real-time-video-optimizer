# Real-Time Video Streaming Optimization

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent system to optimize video streaming quality and reduce latency by dynamically adapting to real-time network conditions and user preferences. By combining network optimization techniques, real-time data processing, machine learning, and advanced video compression, the system enhances user experience by automatically adjusting streaming parameters such as bitrate, buffering strategies, and bandwidth allocation.
